# Why

Many components of the magic mirror pages are reused, so I am adding this directory to abstract reused components.

Research on ways to have modular components in html:
- [this tutorial](https://css-tricks.com/an-introduction-to-web-components/), about creating custom html tags.
  - Custom Elements
    - Use JS to define html tags
    - Using names with hyphens is good
    - I will use this way for now
  - Use templates
    - Need JS to include templates from other files
    - HTML imports exist, but they are deprecated
- [this one](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_html_include.asp) on including html
  - I like the idea of it, but the code is a lil bulky, I don't want to use js that I don't understand
